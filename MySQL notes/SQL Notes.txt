How to create a Database
First create the database name then (use) this keyword to use it
Then create a table with using the table keyword
Let me talk about the topic which is confusing for me
Constraints
Types of Constraints
1. Not Null
2. Default
3. Unique
4. Primary key
5. Foreign key
6. Check constraint


If you want to copy an existing table details to another table you can use the 'AS' keyword to copy all the data
from the existing table


View
A view is a database object that has no values.
It is a virtual table that contains a subset of data within a table.
If any changes occur in the underlying table, the same changes reflected in the views also.
It is operated similarly to the base table but does not contain any data of its own.
Its name is always unique.

View Syntax - CREATE VIEW view_name AS  
SELECT column_lists FROM table_name  
WHERE condition;
